## TypeDef

Creates alias for size_t, which is unsigned int. Now we can use size_t as a type instead of
unsigned int when writing code. AKA providing a new name for an existing type.

`typedef unsigned int size_t`

-Can make code easier to read

    typedef struct student {
        char first_name[20];
    } Student;

    // Now struct student can be declared using Student instead!

    Student s; // A struct student
    Student *p // A pointer to struct student

    

## Macros

Can replace constant vals or eval simple expressions

    #define MAX_NAME_LENGTH 40

    char name[MAX_NAME_LENGTH]; // same as char name[40];


    // Can also define expressions

    #define WITH_TAX(x) ((x) * 1.08)

    // Now we can use it like this:

    double rich = WITH_TAX(5); // evaluates to 5*1.08 BEFORE COMPILATION
